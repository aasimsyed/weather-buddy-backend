# Test Plan for Thunder Buddy

## 1. Overview

Thunder Buddy is a real-time weather and disaster alert system that delivers timely, localized severe weather notifications directly to users' mobile devices. This test plan outlines the strategies and procedures to verify that Thunder Buddy meets its functional and non-functional requirements. The system integrates a Flask-based backend with a PostgreSQL database, third-party APIs (Weatherbit, OneSignal, Google Maps & Geolocation APIs), and a React Native mobile app deployed via Expo Go, along with an analytics module powered by Pandas.

## 2. Test Objectives

- **Functional Validation:**  
  Verify that each feature (weather alert integration, push notifications, interactive maps, alert sharing, and analytics) works as specified.
  
- **Performance Validation:**  
  Ensure that the system can handle expected load levels, particularly during high alert volumes.

- **Reliability and Stability:**  
  Confirm that Thunder Buddy remains stable under continuous usage and during error conditions (e.g., third-party API downtime).

- **User Experience:**  
  Validate that the mobile app is intuitive, responsive, and provides real-time feedback.

- **Security:**  
  Ensure secure user authentication, data integrity, and proper handling of sensitive information.

## 3. Scope

**In Scope:**
- Unit and integration tests for backend endpoints (user management, weather alert processing, notification triggers).
- End-to-end tests for mobile app flows (registration, alert viewing, map interactions, alert sharing).
- Performance testing for critical components such as the notification service and analytics module.
- Regression testing for each sprint to ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality.
- Usability and accessibility testing for the mobile app.

**Out of Scope:**
- Full-scale production load testing beyond MVP expectations.
- Deep performance testing of third-party APIs (Weatherbit, OneSignal, Google Maps) beyond basic integration tests.

## 4. Test Approach

### 4.1. Testing Levels

- **Unit Testing:**  
  Develop unit tests for individual functions and endpoints using `pytest` for backend modules and Jest (if applicable) for React Native components.

- **Integration Testing:**  
  Test the interactions between components (e.g., API-to-database, API-to-external services) using `pytest` with Flaskâ€™s testing utilities and mocks/stubs for third-party APIs.

- **System Testing:**  
  Validate complete workflows by simulating real-world scenarios (e.g., a severe weather event triggers notifications, updates the map view, and logs user engagement).

- **End-to-End Testing:**  
  Use Detox to automate full user journeys on the mobile app, including registration, login, receiving notifications, and interacting with maps.

- **Regression Testing:**  
  Execute automated test suites after every sprint to ensure no previously validated functionality is broken by new changes.

### 4.2. Shift-Left Testing

- Integrate testing early in the development cycle by writing unit tests as features are developed.
- Encourage collaboration between developers and QA to design test cases concurrently with feature specification.
- Incorporate automated tests into the CI/CD pipeline for continuous feedback.

## 5. Test Environment

- **Backend Environment:**  
  A staging environment running the Flask application, configured with a PostgreSQL database and using sandbox/test keys for Weatherbit, OneSignal, and Google Maps APIs.
  
- **Mobile App Environment:**  
  Emulators and real devices running the React Native app via Expo Go.
  
- **Testing Tools:**  
  - `pytest` for backend unit and integration testing.
  - Detox for end-to-end testing of the mobile app.
  - Optional tools such as Locust or JMeter for performance/load testing.

## 6. Test Data

- **User Data:**  
  Predefined test accounts representing various roles (e.g., regular users, emergency responders).

- **Weather Data:**  
  Simulated severe weather events using mocked responses from the Weatherbit API.

- **Geolocation Data:**  
  Simulated GPS coordinates to test location-based alert filtering.

- **Notification Data:**  
  Dummy payloads and logs to test OneSignal push notifications.

## 7. Roles & Responsibilities

- **Backend Developers:**  
  - Write and maintain unit and integration tests for API endpoints.
  - Ensure robust error handling and proper logging.
  - Collaborate with QA to design test cases for data processing and external API integrations.

- **Frontend Developers:**  
  - Develop and maintain unit tests for React Native components.
  - Work with QA to create and execute Detox tests.
  - Resolve UI/UX issues identified during testing.

- **QA Engineers:**  
  - Develop comprehensive test cases (both manual and automated).
  - Execute tests, monitor results, and document defects.
  - Ensure integration of testing into the CI/CD pipeline.

- **DevOps/CI Administrators:**  
  - Set up and maintain the CI/CD pipeline.
  - Integrate automated tests to run on every commit and report issues promptly.

## 8. Test Schedule & Milestones

- **Sprint 1:**  
  - Set up test environments.
  - Complete unit tests for core backend endpoints (user management, weather alert integration).
  - Begin end-to-end tests for basic mobile app flows.

- **Sprint 2:**  
  - Expand integration tests for location services and alert sharing.
  - Enhance end-to-end test coverage for new mobile features (interactive maps, alert sharing).
  - Initiate performance testing for push notifications and data processing.

- **Sprint 3:**  
  - Finalize all test suites.
  - Perform comprehensive regression testing.
  - Conduct usability and accessibility tests.
  - Execute full end-to-end scenarios simulating real-world weather events.

## 9. Risks & Mitigation

- **Third-Party API Downtime:**  
  - **Risk:** Downtime or slow responses from Weatherbit, OneSignal, or Google Maps.
  - **Mitigation:** Use mocked responses and sandbox environments during testing.

- **Data Volume:**  
  - **Risk:** High volumes of engagement data could slow analytics processing.
  - **Mitigation:** Implement performance testing and optimize database queries.

- **Device Variability:**  
  - **Risk:** Inconsistent behavior on different mobile devices.
  - **Mitigation:** Test across a range of emulators and physical devices.

- **CI/CD Failures:**  
  - **Risk:** Automated tests may fail due to integration issues.
  - **Mitigation:** Regularly update test scripts and closely monitor the CI/CD pipeline.

## 10. Test Deliverables

- **Test Plan Document:** This document.
- **Test Cases and Scripts:**

## 11. Conclusion

This test plan employs a comprehensive, multi-layered approach integrated early in the development cycle (shift-left) within a Lean Agile framework. By validating functionality, performance, usability, and security at every step, Thunder Buddy will deliver a robust, reliable, and user-centric solution. Regular integration of tests within our CI/CD pipeline ensures continuous improvement and rapid iteration, enabling us to deliver a high-quality product that meets both user needs and business objectives.
