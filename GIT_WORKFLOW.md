# Gitflow Workflow: Comprehensive Guide

## Overview

Gitflow is a robust branching model designed to manage larger projects by standardizing the development workflow. It uses different branches for managing features, releases, and hotfixes while maintaining a clear project history.

## Core Branches

### Main Branch (main)
- Houses production-ready code
- All code here is deployable
- Never commit directly to main
- Tagged with version numbers

### Development Branch (develop)
- Primary branch for development work
- Contains latest delivered development changes
- Source branch for feature branches
- Merged back into main during releases

## Supporting Branches

### Feature Branches
- Branch naming: feature/feature-name
- Branched from: develop
- Merged back into: develop
- Used for developing new features
- Exists until feature is completed

### Release Branches
- Branch naming: release/x.x.x
- Branched from: develop
- Merged back into: develop and main
- Used for release preparation
- Only bug fixes, documentation, and release-oriented tasks

### Hotfix Branches
- Branch naming: hotfix/x.x.x
- Branched from: main
- Merged back into: main and develop
- Used for emergency production fixes

## Detailed Workflow Steps

### Starting a New Project

1. Create the main repository
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

2. Create develop branch
```bash
git checkout -b develop main
git push -u origin develop
```

### Feature Development Workflow

1. Create feature branch
```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
```

2. Work on feature
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Feature: implement new functionality"
```

3. Update feature branch with latest develop changes
```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout feature/new-feature
git merge develop
```

4. Complete feature development
```bash
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff feature/new-feature
git push origin develop
git branch -d feature/new-feature
```

### Release Process

1. Create release branch
```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b release/1.0.0
```

2. Make release-specific changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Release 1.0.0: update version number"
```

3. Finalize release
```bash
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff release/1.0.0
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Version 1.0.0"
git push origin main --tags

git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff release/1.0.0
git push origin develop

git branch -d release/1.0.0
```

### Hotfix Process

1. Create hotfix branch
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/1.0.1
```

2. Fix the bug
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Hotfix: fix critical bug"
```

3. Complete hotfix
```bash
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff hotfix/1.0.1
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Version 1.0.1"
git push origin main --tags

git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff hotfix/1.0.1
git push origin develop

git branch -d hotfix/1.0.1
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Feature Pull Requests

1. Title Format: "Feature: Brief description"
2. Required Information:
   - Detailed description of changes
   - Link to related issue/ticket
   - Screenshots/videos (if UI changes)
   - Testing steps
3. Review Requirements:
   - Code review by at least two team members
   - All automated tests passing
   - No merge conflicts with develop
   - Code style compliance
4. Merge Strategy:
   - Squash and merge to develop
   - Delete feature branch after merge

### Release Pull Requests

1. Title Format: "Release: vX.X.X"
2. Required Information:
   - Complete changelog
   - Test results summary
   - Deployment notes
3. Review Requirements:
   - QA sign-off
   - Product owner approval
   - All release tests passing
4. Merge Strategy:
   - Create two PRs:
     - Release branch → main
     - Release branch → develop
   - Use --no-ff merge

### Hotfix Pull Requests

1. Title Format: "Hotfix: Brief description"
2. Required Information:
   - Description of the bug
   - Impact assessment
   - Testing evidence
   - Rollback plan
3. Review Requirements:
   - Emergency review team approval
   - Hotfix test suite passing
   - Security review (if applicable)
4. Merge Strategy:
   - Create two PRs:
     - Hotfix branch → main
     - Hotfix branch → develop
   - Use --no-ff merge

## Best Practices

1. Branch Management
   - Regular cleanup of merged feature branches
   - Enforce branch naming conventions
   - Protected branches: main and develop

2. Commit Guidelines
   - Clear, descriptive commit messages
   - One logical change per commit
   - Sign commits when possible

3. Code Review
   - Use pull request templates
   - Implement mandatory code review
   - Automate style checks and testing

4. Version Control
   - Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
   - Tag all releases
   - Maintain changelog

5. Continuous Integration
   - Automated testing on all branches
   - Build verification
   - Deployment pipelines

6. Documentation
   - Update docs with code changes
   - Maintain README
   - Document breaking changes
